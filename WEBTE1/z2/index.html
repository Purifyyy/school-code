                    <div class="tltext">Is the father of Ransom and the husband of Linda. Though he chastises Ransom
                        for his spoiled
                        behavior, he is just as big of a freeloader as he relies on his wife's fortune.It is also
                        revealed
                        that Richard was having an affair behind Linda's back and tried to threaten her father when he
                        found
                        out. Overall, Richard an ignorant man who pretends to be caring but really harbors narrow-minded
                        and
                        hateful political beliefs.

                    <h2>Jacob Thrombey</h2>
                    <img src="jacob.jpg" alt="jacob">

                    <div class="tltext">Is the youngest member of the Thrombey family and one of the most unnerving. He
                        doesn't say much throughout the movie as he is constantly on his phone. However, the rest of the
                        family says he has some disturbing far-right beliefs with Richard even saying, "The boy is
                        literally a Nazi."

                        While Jacob stays in the background for much of the movie, once Marta is revealed to be the sole
                        heir of his grandfather's fortune, he spews some vile and racist insults at her, proving his
                        family was correct about his behavior.

                    <div class="tltext">Is Harlan's youngest child and he helps run the publishing company, though he
                        actually does very little work. However, Walt also wants to profit off of his father's name and
                        keeps pressuring him to sell the rights to his books.

                        While Walt also treats Marta like family, he quickly changes his tune when she gets all of
                        Harlan's money. Walt still pretends to be a friendly and supportive person while also subtly
                        threatening to expose Marta's mother as an undocumented immigrant.

                    <img src="meg.jpg" alt="meg">

                    <div class="tltext">Is the daughter of Joni and someone who seems quite different than the rest of
                        the family. She sees herself as a caring person and makes an effort to show support to Marta and
                        the other staff of the house.

                        When Marta is named as the heir to Harlan's fortune, Meg initially thinks that the family should
                        respect Harlan's wishes. That changes when she learns her mother cannot pay for Meg's university
                        on her own. Meg's kind nature disappears as she tells the family about Marta's mother, though
                        she does quickly regret it.

                    <img src="hugh.jpg" alt="hugh">

                    <div class="tltext">Given how noble and heroic Chris Evans is as Captain America in the MCU, it's
                        surprising to see him play the least likable character in any movie. But Evans was clearly
                        having a ball playing against type as the entitled, spoiled and nefarious Ransom Drysdale.

                        Even before he shows up in the movie, Ransom doesn't come across very well. He is the black
                        sheep of the family who treats "the help" deplorably and expects to float through life on his
                        inheritance. In the end, Ransom is revealed to be much worse as he plots to murder his
                        grandfather, successfully murders Fran, and tries to frame Marta for it.

                    <h2>Benoit Blanc</h2>
                    <img src="benoit.jpg" alt="benoit">

                    <div class="tltext">Johnson has talked about his desire to follow detective Benoit Blanc on other
                        mysteries, and given how likable of a character he is, it's hard not to get excited by the
                        prospect. Blanc is a famed gumshoe who finds himself looking into the death of Harlan Thrombey.

                        Though he is compelled by the facts of the case, he is not a cold or emotionally cut-off
                        detective like Sherlock Holmes but rather recognizes the good in people and seeks to punish
                        those who have done wrong.

                    <h2>Linda Drysdale</h2>
                    <img src="linda.jpg" alt="linda">

                    <div class="tltext">Is the oldest child of Harlan Thrombey and seems to step in as the head of the
                        family after his death. She claims to be a self-made woman, despite getting a lot of help from
                        her father. But unlike some of the other family members, she had no hidden secrets Harlan found
                        out about. In fact, she seemed to be very close with her father and genuinely misses him.

                        Despite all of that, Linda is still driven by greed. She acts friendly to Marta at first, but
                        when her money is threatened, she becomes the most vocal and terrifying voice against her.

                        before the events of the movie. Joni Thrombey is his widow and remains close with the family.
                        However, it seems like she only does so in order to benefit from the money.

                        Joni is revealed to have been stealing money from Harlan and claiming it was going towards her
                        daughter's college payments. When Marta gets the inheritance, Joni tries to get her daughter
                        Meg, Marta's friend, to turn against her.

                    <div class="tltext">The movie sets itself apart from other murder mysteries by showing the audience
                        what
                        happened with the death very early on in the movie and showing that it is Harlan's nurse, Marta
                        Cabrera, who is at fault. However, even this is not quite as it seems.

                        Though she seems to have made a terrible mistake, she is not some self-centered person only
                        concerned with saving herself. In fact, Marta still thinks of others first even when she is at
                        risk. In the end, she is revealed to be a good nurse who did everything she was supposed to.
                        Despite being surrounded by some awful people, Marta remained a good person.

                        part of this story. He is a famed mystery novelist who has supported his family for many years
                        before getting tired of their deceit and greediness.

                        Harlan is shown to have an extremely close bond with Marta and is willing to die to protect her.
                        When he thinks he has been given a lethal dose of morphine, Harlan's only concern is ensuring
                        Marta is not blamed for this and kills himself to keep her safe.
